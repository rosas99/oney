                ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
                 users must create. This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta.

                 ObjectMeta is embedded in `Miner.Spec` and `MinerSet.Template`,
                 which are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases
                 and read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies
                 the API and some issues that can impact user experience.

                 During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054)
                 for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs,
                 specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: "null"`.
                 The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version
                 when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package.

                 In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta`
                 had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time).
                 The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null`
                 which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable.

                 In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded
                 types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.

                 New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                  2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                     restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                     Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                     during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                     and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                  5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                     will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                 Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

                 Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set,
                 or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats:
                 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map
                 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item
                 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list
                 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values
                 If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

                 The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

                         is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry

                         in this list can only be removed.
                         Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
                         because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
                         finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
                         If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
                         in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
                         waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
                         component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
                         Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                         are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
